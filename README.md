## 🚀 About Me

I'm a developer and systems thinker driven by the mission to make advanced AI both accessible and secure. My work centers on building modular, privacy-focused tools that function seamlessly in high-stakes environments — without requiring massive infrastructure.

Through my R&D company, **Extravio**, I'm focused on embedding intelligent systems into existing infrastructure to remove the barriers of cost, complexity, and connectivity.

### 🎯 Current Focus:
- ⚙️ **CharKey** – An offline-first, USB-based AI engine running tuned language models for edge environments.
- ☁️ Hybrid architecture: secure local processing with optional cloud sync via Microsoft Azure.
- 🔐 Serving researchers, field operators, and security-focused professionals.
